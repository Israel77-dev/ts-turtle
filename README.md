# TS-Turtle

An implementation of turtle graphics, inspired by the [Logo programming language](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)>), created by Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon.

This implementation aims to be simple and modular, with the possibility of using its parts separately or as a standalone web app.
